# Getting-and-Cleaning-data
CodeBook.md describes how to use the script, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the analyses within 5 steps. They can be finished in RStudio by importing the file. Here are the five steps:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output is the tidy data we want
